  Conditions to be used during testing. A condition knows how to get the state of an element to verify
  and can perform verifications on this element if a requested state is reached.
</p>

<p>
  The central interface is {@link Condition}. All class implementing this interface should
  also implement {@link FailSafeCondition}. This interface is hidden at first
  glance to represent a small API to the condition users. Typically those building conditions will need
  the interface {@link FailSafeCondition} to configure the
  behavior of the condition.
</p>

<p>
  Another concept you can find here is the concept of timeouts. The conditions use a
  {@link net.joala.condition.old.TimeoutProvider} to retrieve the timeout which this way can be configured per test.
  In contrast to adjust fixed timeouts for some conditions you can adjust the factor to wait for a condition. Thus
  you can say that it will take twice as much time for a condition to be fulfilled. This way your test implementation
  does not need to know for example how slow connection is and such.
