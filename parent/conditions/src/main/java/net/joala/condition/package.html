  Conditions to be used during testing. A condition knows how to get the state of an element to verify
  and can perform verifications on this element if a requested state is reached.
</p>

<p>
  The central interface is {@link net.joala.condition.Condition}. All class implementing this interface should
  also implement {@link net.joala.condition.FailSafeCondition}. This interface is hidden at first
  glance to represent a small API to the condition users. Typically those building conditions will need
  the interface {@link net.joala.condition.FailSafeCondition} to configure the
  behavior of the condition.
