<p >
  Aspects to support JUnit tests written with Gherkin like syntax. These aspects are solely related to
  logging so that you have a similar logging result as from well known BDD frameworks like Cucumber and
  JBehave.

  For a detailed description of the BDD approach in Joala read the package documentation for
  {@link net.joala.bdd}.
