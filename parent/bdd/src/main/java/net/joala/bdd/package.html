<p>
  Support to write JUnit tests in BDD style.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Subpackages</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>{@link net.joala.bdd.aop} for aspects required for logging</li>
  <li>{@link net.joala.bdd.reference} for classes to carry information between steps</li>
  <li>{@link net.joala.bdd.watcher} JUnit rules to support logging of stories</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Intention</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You might know this problem: 10 years ago some developer wrote a sophisticated test to test some implemented
  feature. 10 years ago this person knew the feature very well and wrote a test with many preparation steps and
  perhaps with some assertions. Guess - this person might have been you.
</p>

<p>
  Now, 10 years later, your product got refactored many times. The once so obvious feature is hidden somewhere or
  you just forgot about it. But suddenly the test fails. It might be that you just removed the feature - perhaps by
  intention to get rid of dead unused code. But could you tell this from the test which now fails? If you are lucky.
  Practice tells another story. Sometimes you glare at the test and don't understand a word. What was it meant to do?
  What did it test?
</p>

<p>
  Joala BDD provides a solution for this using a well known language template to write tests and without the need
  to learn any other technology. You just need to know Java - and perhaps need a slight idea about Spring.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Approach</strong>
</p>

<p>
  BDD is the acronym for Behavior Driven Development. You describe a wanted behavior. And if you do it in a formal
  language, the description can be used for automated tests. This is where tools like
  <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> or <a href="http://jbehave.org/">JBehave</a> started.
  The formal language used is called Gherkin.
</p>

<p>
  If you start with 3rd party tools you will need to find the one which is best supported by your IDE. Otherwise
  you will get stuck like many others did with a heap of unmaintainable stories you cannot refactor.
</p>

<p>
  Joala BDD stays in the world of Java - and such you have full refactoring support in your IDE and can use
  many static code analysis tools like for example locating unused step definitions.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>References</strong>
</p>

<p>
  If you describe a story step by step you typically need to carry information between those steps. For example
  you create a HTML document in one preparation step (<em>Given</em>), fill in some unicode text into that document
  in the action step (<em>When</em>) and eventually you assert that the text is correctly rendered in a browser
  (<em>Then</em>).
</p>

<p>
  Using methods with return values will degrade the readability of your tests and you will stumble across
  preparation steps preparing multiple test artifacts. References are the solution. They are used as container
  for the prepared objects and have advantages like providing properties for later assertions. See more in
  the next chapter.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Concepts/Recommendations</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The following describes a set of concepts and/or recommendations. You don't need to stick to all of them
  but the following approach promises to work best. Mind that most steps are only done once in case you use
  a base class for your tests (which is recommended). Thus to create the real story files later on is most
  of the time a piece of cake.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Create the Story Test:</em> Create a test class named {@code StoryMyFeatureTitleTest}.</li>
  <li><em>Add Test Watcher:</em> Add a JUnit rule in order to provide logging for Story class and
    scenario test methods. It is good practice to do this configuration in a base class all story classes
    inherit from:
  <pre>
&#64;Rule
public final TestWatcher testWatcher = new JUnitScenarioWatcher();
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>Use JUnit Runner from Spring:</em> The logging approach uses Spring AOP to log the different steps.
    As first approach you need to ensure that Spring is used to run the tests by anotating the test class (or its
    base class) with the following:
  <pre>
&#64;RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
&#64;ContextConfiguration
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>Prepare Test Context:</em> The context configuration is small and can be used just as is only setting
    the correct package where to find your test classes:
  <pre>
&lt;import resource="classpath:META-INF/joala/bdd/bdd-context.xml"/>
&lt;context:component-scan base-package="your.test.package"/>
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>Create a Spring Bean for Steps:</em> As we use Spring AOP you need to give Spring control over the
    step-methods. To do so we use an internal class with the strange looking name '_' (underscore). All for the
    sake to have readable tests later on:
  <pre>
&#64;Inject
&#64;Singleton
public Steps _;
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>Create a scenario:</em> Now let's start with a scenario. Use the following pattern:
  <pre>
&#64;Test
public scenario_describe_title_with_underscores() throws Exception {
  ...
}
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>Write your scenario steps:</em> Just type your scenario steps - even if they are read. Your IDE
    will assist you in creating the correct methods later on. We now use the Steps Bean which will later
    contain the step methods. Mind to name your references clearly in the steps:
  <pre>
&#64;Test
public scenario_describe_title_with_underscores() throws Exception {
  _.given_there_is_a_HTML_document_D();
  _.when_the_HTML_document_D_contains_unicode_text_U();
  _.when_I_open_document_D_with_browser_B();
  _.then_browser_B_correctly_renders_text_U();
}
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>Use References:</em> Now we need to carry the information from step to step about the different
    test artifacts. We use the statically imported method {@code ref()} from utility class {@code References}:
  <pre>
&#64;Test
public scenario_describe_title_with_underscores() throws Exception {
  Reference&lt;File> documentD = ref("D");
  Reference&lt;String> textU = ref("U");
  Reference&lt;WebDriver> browserB = ref("B");

  _.given_there_is_a_HTML_document_D(documentD);
  _.when_the_HTML_document_D_contains_unicode_text_U(documentD, textU);
  _.when_I_open_document_D_with_browser_B(browserB);
  _.then_browser_B_correctly_renders_text_U(browserB, textU);
}
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>Implement the steps:</em> Now let your IDE implement the missing methods and fill them with live.
    Now you are free to code as you like. The test body will always ensure that you have a good documentation
    of your test - for now and for ever.
  </li>
  <li><em>Configure SLF4j Logging:</em> Next you should configure logging in that way that the stories, scenarios
    and steps are logged. Assuming that you use Logback you can use the provided configuration file like this:
  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;configuration>
  &lt;include resource="META-INF/joala/bdd/bdd-logback.xml"/>
  &lt;root level="warn">
      ...
  &lt;/root>
&lt;/configuration>
  </pre>
    This configures the logging for BDD to be done to console. If you want to log the stories, scenarios and steps
    to a file appender in addition you can simply define additional loggers:
  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;configuration>
  &lt;include resource="META-INF/joala/bdd/bdd-logback.xml"/>
  &lt;logger name="${bdd.story.logger.name}" level="${bdd.log.level}">
    &lt;appender-ref ref="myFileAppender"/>
  &lt;/logger>
  &lt;logger name="${bdd.steps.logger.name}" level="${bdd.log.level}">
    &lt;appender-ref ref="myFileAppender"/>
  &lt;/logger>
  &lt;root level="warn">
      ...
  &lt;/root>
&lt;/configuration>
  </pre>
  </li>
</ol>
