  Contains classes to provide data as test artifacts for your tests.
</p>
<p>
  When dealing with tests you often need to get some data. Most of the time data where the real content
  actually does not matter. The data just need to match certain criteria - they should be numeric,
  should be in a given range or whatever.
</p>
<p>
  This package provides providers for data. The central package is {@link net.joala.data.random} which will
  generate several random data for you.
