<p>
  Testlets are set of tests to apply to a software under test (SUT). Testlets itself
  contain multiple tests which are run with the provided SUT to see if it meets
  a bunch of requirements specified through the testlet.
</p>
<p>
  A typical testlet is the {@link net.joala.lab.junit.testlet.TestToString toString() testlet}:
  It assumes that you want to put all fields of a class into the toString() output and that the
  classname itself should be mentioned in the resulting output. The testlet verifies these
  assumptions.
