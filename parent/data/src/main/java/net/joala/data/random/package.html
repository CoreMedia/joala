  Contains classes to generate random data.
</p>
<p>
  Classes in this package are responsible to provide test data to your tests. Test data which are created
  by random. Data providers which provide random data typically need to restrict the random values to a certain
  valid (or invalid) set of data. To do so a typical random data provider in this package follows the builder
  pattern in order to parametrize the random data provider before retrieving random data from it.
