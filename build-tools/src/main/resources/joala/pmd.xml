    PMD Rulesets to apply to the Joala Project.

    To suppress selected warnings in the code use for example:

        @SuppressWarnings("PMD.ShortMethodName")

    For available rulesets have a look at the version of PMD used by the maven-pmd-plugin. Currently it is
    pmd:pmd:4.3 which for example does not know empty.xml as ruleset.

      Discussion:

      The value might be adjusted if you think it is appropriate. The value should be enough to provide
      self documenting variable names and should still be easy to read. Thus as for books a typical line
      length limit is 50 to 70 characters the length for one single variable name should not be bigger.

      The default limit of 17 characters is considered to be to small to stick to self describing variable names.
