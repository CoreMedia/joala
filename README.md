# Joala - Enjoy Testing


## Documentation

For complete documentation of Joala please visit [Joala Pages][].

## Versions Contract

For version changes the following contract exists:

* The version consists of three digits: `#.#.#`
* #.#.#: The third digit changes on important bug-fix-releases. Thus you should always use the highest available digit.
* The second digit changes for bug-fix and feature-releases. Releases might add new deprecation warnings.
* The first digit changes for breaking API changes. Any deprecations from previous releases might vanish.
