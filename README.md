# Joala - Enjoy Testing

## About

Joala started in 2011 as project to unify efforts to write robust UI integration tests.
Joala is an extract of these efforts, especially originating from the efforts to create
a common wait pattern which cannot be only used for UI tests but also for any other
integration tests where you have to wait for system responses before you can continue
with your test.

Joala artefacts have been published to _Maven Central_ up to release
[1.2.1](https://github.com/coremedia/joala/tree/joala-1.2.1). You can find complete documentation on older
releases of Joala at [Joala Pages][].

Starting with release 2.0.0, the artefacts are no longer published.

If you'd like to use the project in your own context, it must be cloned, built, installed and deployed manually.
